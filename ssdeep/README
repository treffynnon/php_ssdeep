ssdeep fuzzy hashing for php
====================

Requirements
-------

  - Linux (tested on Ubuntu)
  - ssdeep (tested with 2.5 built from source)
  - PHP (tested on 5.3)
  

Usage
-------

Three functions are exposed:

  - ssdeep_fuzzy_hash_filename()
  - ssdeep_fuzzy_hash()
  - ssdeep_fuzzy_compare()

ssdeep_fuzzy_hash_filename() allows you to supply a path to a file you would like to get a hash of:

    $hash1 = ssdeep_fuzzy_hash_filename('/home/simon/text.text');


ssdeep_fuzzy_hash() will return a hash when it is supplied a string:

    $hash2 = ssdeep_fuzzy_hash('A piece of text would go here!');

ssdeep_fuzzy_compare() compares two hashes and returns their match percentage:

    $match = ssdeep_fuzzy_compare($hash1, $hash2);

Also see the test.php file for more examples of how this can be used.


Installing the ssdeep package
-------

I would recommend building ssdeep from source using the [instructions][1] from it's [project site][2]. Once done **you need** to copy `.libs/*` to `/usr/lib` so that the php_ssdeep extension can see the ssdeep libraries.

    sudo cp .libs/* /usr/lib

You can use the packages supplied with Ubuntu or Debian, but they are not yet updated to the latest version of ssdeep.

If you are having trouble building or running the php_ssdeep extension it expects to see the following directory structure:

> /usr/bin/ssdeep
>
> /usr/include/fuzzy.h
>
> /usr/lib/libfuzzy.a
>
> /usr/lib/libfuzzy.la
>
> /usr/lib/libfuzzy.so
>
> /usr/lib/libfuzzy.so.2
>
> /usr/lib/libfuzzy.so.2.0.0
